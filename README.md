🎯 Usage
Basic Workflow
Edit HTML
Open index.html in your code editor
Experiment with Tailwind utility classes (e.g., bg-blue-500, text-center, p-4)
Save and refresh your browser to see changes
Add Custom Styles
Modify input.css to add custom CSS or Tailwind directives
The watch command will automatically recompile to output.css
Explore Examples
Review the pre-built components in index.html
Study how utility classes combine to create complex layouts
Refer to toolkit.md for guided exercises
Example: Creating a Button
html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
Example: Responsive Layout
html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded">Card 1</div>
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded">Card 2</div>
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded">Card 3</div>
</div>

⚙ Configuration Options
Customizing Tailwind
Edit tailwind.config.js to customize your Tailwind setup:
javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["./*.html"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-blue': '#1e40af',
      },
      fontFamily: {
        'custom': ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Adding Custom CSS
In input.css, you can add custom styles alongside Tailwind directives:
css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-700;
  }
}
Build Commands
Development build with watch mode:
bash
 npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
Production build (minified):
bash
 npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --minify

🐛 Troubleshooting
CSS not updating?
Ensure the watch command is running (--watch flag)
Check that output.css is linked correctly in index.html
Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
Styles not appearing?
Verify that your HTML file is listed in tailwind.config.js under content
Make sure Tailwind directives are in input.css
Check for typos in utility class names
Build errors?
Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed: node -v and npm -v
Delete node_modules and reinstall: rm -rf node_modules && npm install
Check that all dependencies are installed: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
Classes not working?
Tailwind uses exact class names — bg-blue-500 works, but bg-blue-550 doesn't
Some utilities require configuration (check Tailwind docs)
Use browser DevTools to inspect and debug styles
